# SnakeGame
Its a data structure(linked list) project implemented in C language.
To move the snake, use 'w' for up, 'z' for down, 'a' for left and 'd' for right.
Again, there are constants you can change if you want to alter these settings.
Press 'x' to exit the game at any time and your current position and score will be saved in a file.
So when you press old game you can continue with your previously played data. 
The aim of the game is to collect the * (food) and avoid the obstacles
( snake itself). As you collect food, the snake gets
longer, so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself.
